### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack dev with a year of experience, lover of programming and technology.

My actual stack is Javascript, with Node.js. I like to work with relational databases  (MySQL, Postgres) and NoSQL (MongoDB).

I've worked with PHP (Laravel), Firebase SDK, Native apps (Android w/ Java), Ionic (hybrid app).
